## Project Overview

This project focuses on uncovering social structures and user behavior patterns within **derStandard.at** by applying advanced network analysis techniques.  
Through the use of multiple community detection algorithms and efficient data processing pipelines, it enhances content targeting and engagement strategies.

## Key Contributions

- **Led Community Detection Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis of user interactions to identify key communities and social trends.
- **Applied Multiple Algorithms**: Utilized six different network analysis algorithms to detect and map user communities, uncovering important engagement and behavior patterns.
- **Enhanced Insights**: Improved understanding of active user groups, supporting better content targeting and engagement strategies.
- **Automated Data Pipelines**: Developed and automated data workflows using **R**, **igraph**, and **dplyr** to process large-scale datasets reliably and efficiently.

## Results
* Here are some output plots based on small dataset, that show detected communities using the menttioned algorithms. For more information, you can have a look at the [report](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fgqqbqstwypq) and [R Markdown document](doc/Community-Detection_smal_dataset.md).
